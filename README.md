👋 Hi there! I'm a Full Stack Developer with a passion for creating dynamic and user-friendly web applications. I specialize in Django and have a solid foundation in both front-end and back-end technologies.

Skills
Languages: Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Java, 
Frameworks: Django, jQuery, ReactJs, Django Rest Framework,
Styling: Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS
Databases: MySQL, PostgreSQL
Deployment: Linode
I love turning ideas into reality and constantly seek to learn new technologies and improve my skills. Whether it's crafting a responsive design or optimizing back-end performance, I enjoy the challenges that come with full stack development.

When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new tech trends, contributing to open-source projects, or working on personal projects.

Feel free to check out my repositories and connect with me!
